# Bitcoin Script Execution Simulator

## Overview

This project provides an interactive, visual simulator for Bitcoin script execution, designed for both beginners and advanced users to learn and experiment with Bitcoin transaction scripts. The simulator supports various Bitcoin transaction types, including Taproot, P2PKH, SegWit, and P2SH multisignature transactions.

## Features

- **Interactive step-by-step script execution**: Visualize each operation and stack change as the script is processed.
- **Support for multiple Bitcoin script types**: Taproot, P2PKH, SegWit, and P2SH multisig.
- **Realistic transaction data**: Example transactions with real scripts and witness data.
- **Educational explanations**: Each step is accompanied by a clear description of the operation.
- **Modern, responsive UI**: Works well on both desktop and mobile browsers.

## How to Use

1. **Clone or download this repository.**
2. **Open `index.html` in your web browser.**
   - No server or build step is required; everything runs client-side.
3. **Select a transaction type** (Taproot, P2PKH, SegWit, or P2SH) from the top menu.
4. **Click "Next"** to step through the script execution, or use "Auto execute" to run all steps automatically.
5. **Observe the stack and logs** to understand how Bitcoin script verification works.

## Who is this for?
